rFeed is an awesome and real world-class feeds processor.

It uses rFeedParser for its parsing basic needs and ActiveRecord for DB abstraction.

It's being made by the people at Axiombox (http://axiombox.com). Take a look at
the AUTHORS file for details. Also COPYING. And also WHY.

This software shouldn't be used by production environments since it may kill
your system. No, seriously. Yet.
